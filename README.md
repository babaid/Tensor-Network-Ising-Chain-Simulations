# FOPRA32-2022


Thanks for signing up for the FOPRA 32 "Tensor-Network Simulations of Bound States in Perturbed Quantum Ising Chains". The course is taking place in Cip-Pool 1 of the physics departmetn on Thursday, 1st December, and Friday, 2nd December 2022. We are meeting on Thursday at 8:30 for the introduction. Please make sure to carefully read the manual beforehand (see also attachment). We'll have an initial discussion about the content including questions about the theory background.

## Getting started

Starting with downloading the git repository by running the following command:
```
git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge82ziv/fopra32_ws2022.git
```
If you want to keep your own copy, you could first fork the project and then download the repository from your git repository.

To work on the solution, a working python installation is required, preferably including jupyter notebook. You can also use the facilities provided by the physics Cip-pools.

For the setup, you can choose for instance one of the options below:

(1) Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download
(2) Google colab https://colab.research.google.com/ from web brower without
any installation

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Best wishes,
Ra√∫l Morral Yepes
